    "## Coordinate Ascent Update for Mean-Field Variational Bayes\n",
    "Variational Bayes (Variational Inference) is a functional optimization procedure designed to find the best approximating distribution, $q({\\bf Z})$, that results in minimum Kullback-Leibler divergence between itself and the posterior distribution of the latent variables given some data, $p({\\bf Z}\\big\\rvert {\\bf X})$. ${\\bf Z}$ and ${\\bf X}$ respectively represent the collection of latent and observation variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "We follow the interpretation presented in [1]. Let ${\\bf X}$ be a set of observations (random variables), ${\\bf Z}$ be some unknown random latent variables. From Bayes's theorem: \n",
    "$$p({\\bf X}) = \\frac{p({\\bf X,\\bf Z})}{p({\\bf Z\\big\\rvert \\bf X})}\\\\\n$$",

    "$$\\hspace{4cm} \\log(p({\\bf X})) = \\log{p({\\bf X, \\bf Z})} - \\log{p({\\bf Z\\big\\rvert \\bf X})}\\\\\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Taking the expectation with respect to some distribution, $q({\\bf Z})$, gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\log(p({\\bf X})) = E_q[\\log{p({\\bf X,\\bf Z})}] - E_q[\\log{p({\\bf Z\\big\\rvert \\bf X})}],\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $E_q[f({\\bf X,\\bf Z})] = \\int q({\\bf Z})f({\\bf X ,\\bf Z})d{\\bf Z}$ and we have used $\\log(p({\\bf X})) = E_q[\\log(p({\\bf X}))]$, since $p({\\bf X})$ does not depend on ${\\bf Z}$. After adding $E_q[\\log(q({\\bf Z}))]$ to and subtracting it from the r.h.s: \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that the marginal distribution of the observations, $p({\\bf X})$, is constant. Therefore, minimizing $E_q[\\log{\\frac{p({\\bf Z\\big\\rvert \\bf X})}{q({\\bf Z})}}]$, which is the KL divergence between $q({\\bf Z})$ and the posterior distribution, is equivalent to maximizing $\\mathcal{L}(q) = E_q[\\log{\\frac{p({\\bf X,\\bf Z})}{q({\\bf Z})}}]$. This maximization forms the **objective of Variational Bayes**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next section describes a special case of VB maximization called Mean-Field approximation (MFA), where $q({\\bf Z}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{K}q_i({\\bf Z}_i)$. The integer $K$ is the number of latent variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maximizing the VB objective\n",
    "We start by inserting the mean-field approximation into the components of $\\mathcal{L}(q) =  E_q[\\log{{p({\\bf X,Z})}]-E_q[\\log{q({\\bf Z})}}]$, separately. The following approach has been adopted from [2]. \n",
